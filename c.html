       <div class="Heading"><h1>C Programming</h1></div>
        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>C</strong> is a powerful and widely-used programming language that was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1972. It is known for its efficiency and control over system resources, making it ideal for system-level programming, operating systems, and embedded systems. C has influenced many later languages, including C++, Java, and Python, due to its simple yet flexible syntax and structured programming approach.</p>

            <h3>Procedural Programming</h3>
            
            <p>C is primarily a procedural programming language, meaning it follows a step-by-step approach with functions and procedures. It emphasizes a clear sequence of actions to solve problems and allows for code reusability through functions. Although not object-oriented like C++ or Java, C provides the necessary building blocks to write modular and organized code using functions, which makes it efficient for many types of applications, including operating systems and hardware drivers.</p>
            
            <h3>Portability and Efficiency</h3>
            
            <p>C is highly portable, meaning code written in C can be compiled and run on different types of machines with little or no modification. Its efficiency in handling low-level operations and direct memory management makes it a preferred choice for applications that need to run fast and with minimal overhead. Many compilers and operating systems are written in C due to its ability to produce highly optimized machine code.</p>
            
            <h3>Memory Management</h3>
            
            <p>Unlike higher-level languages that handle memory automatically, C provides direct control over memory through the use of pointers and manual memory allocation. This gives developers more power but also more responsibility, as improper handling of memory can lead to issues like memory leaks and segmentation faults. The combination of pointers, arrays, and dynamic memory allocation makes C a flexible yet challenging language to master.</p>
            
            <h3>Libraries and Extensions</h3>
            
            <p>C has a rich set of standard libraries that provide essential functions, including input/output operations, string handling, and mathematical computations. Additionally, numerous third-party libraries have been developed to extend C's capabilities in areas such as networking, graphics, and data processing. This allows C to be used in a wide variety of domains, from game development to scientific computing.</p>
            
            <h3>Legacy and Modern Applications</h3>
            
            <p>Despite being over 50 years old, C remains a foundational language in modern computing. It continues to be used in the development of operating systems (like Unix and Linux), embedded systems, and performance-critical applications. Many modern languages are built on or inspired by C's syntax and structure, ensuring its ongoing relevance in the software development world.</p>
            
            <p>Overall, C's combination of performance, control, and portability makes it an essential language for developers looking to work at a low level with hardware or create high-performance applications.</p>
